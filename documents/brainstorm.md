# AI-Driven Physics Simplification Project

## Project Vision
Develop an AI system that automatically derives simplified, physically-valid differential equation models from either natural language descriptions or test data, mimicking the expert engineering workflow of systematic physics simplification.

## Core Problem
Currently, engineers manually simplify complex governing equations (like full Navier-Stokes) by applying physics intuition and rules of thumb. This project aims to automate this process using AI that learns when and how to apply various physics assumptions.

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Top-Down Simplification
- **Start with complete physics**: Full Navier-Stokes, energy equations, species transport
- **Systematic reduction**: AI analyzes data to identify which terms/physics can be safely neglected
- **Physics-informed decisions**: Use dimensionless numbers (Re, Ma, Pr) and data patterns to guide simplification
- **Validation**: Compare simplified model predictions against test data

### Phase 2: Rule Learning Engine
- **Meta-learning**: AI builds knowledge base of when simplifications work/fail
- **Experience accumulation**: Learn patterns like "don't drop viscous terms when Re<100 near walls"
- **Adaptive rules**: Refine simplification criteria based on accumulated success/failure data
- **Physics intuition**: Develop human-like engineering judgment about model complexity

### Phase 3: Automated System Generation
- **Scenario parsing**: Extract physics requirements from descriptions or data
- **Model assembly**: Apply learned simplification rules to derive appropriate equations
- **Code generation**: Convert simplified physics to executable simulation code
- **Validation loop**: Compare results against test data, refine model if needed

## Key Innovation
Rather than discovering physics from scratch, the system learns **when to apply known physics simplifications** - mirroring real engineering practice where experts systematically reduce model complexity while maintaining physical validity.

## Validation Strategy
Generate synthetic test data from known full physics simulations with various noise levels. Test whether the AI can correctly identify the appropriate level of physics simplification by comparing its simplified models against the known ground truth.

## Potential Impact
- **Automated model development**: Reduce time from concept to simulation
- **Optimal model complexity**: Find the simplest physically-valid model for each scenario  
- **Domain knowledge capture**: Systematically encode expert physics intuition
- **Robust design**: Handle multiple physics regimes and operating conditions

## Technical Foundation
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for constraint enforcement
- Symbolic computation for equation manipulation
- Meta-learning frameworks for rule acquisition
- Computation graphs for systematic physics term management
